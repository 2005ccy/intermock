# intermock
Mocking library to create mock objects and JSON for TypeScript interfaces via Faker.

**This is not an officially supported Google product**

## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:google/intermock.git
npm install
```
## Usage
Intermockâ€™s API exports only one function, as seen below:

### Function
```typescript
// Returns an object or string based on `output` property specified in `Options`
mock(options: Options): object|string
```

### Options
```typescript
export interface Options {
 // Array of file tuples. (filename, data)
 files?: Array<[string, string]>;

 // TypeScript is currently the only supported language
 language?: SupportedLanguage;

 // Specific interfaces to write to output
 interfaces?: string[];

 // Used for testing mode,
 isFixedMode?: boolean;

 // One of object|json|string. Strings have their object's functions
 // stringified.
 output?: OutputType;

 // Should optional properties always be enabled
 isOptionalAlwaysEnabled?: boolean;
}
```

## Type Support
The following TypeScript static type features are supported:
- Interfaces
- Interfaces with properties of primitive types
- Interfaces with property references to other complex types
- Interfaces with extensions
- Type aliases
- Arrays
- Namespaces
- Functions (stringified output!)
- Optional properties
- Specific fake data types (via JSDoc comment)
